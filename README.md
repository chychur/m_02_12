# FastAPI

Let's create a REST API for storing and managing contacts. The API will be built using the FastAPI infrastructure and use SQLAlchemy for database management.

The contact model is given below:
```commandline
{
    "first_name": "string",
    "last_name": "string",
    "birthday": "2023-09-11",
    "email": "string",
    "phone": "string",
    "address": "string",
    "user_id": int
}
```

The user model is given below:
```commandline
{
    "username": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "create_at": "2023-09-11",
    "refresh_token": "string"
}
```

The application has an authentication and authorization mechanism using `JWT tokens`, so that all operations with contacts are performed only by registered users. The user has only operations with his contacts.

When registering, if a user already exists with the same email, the server will return an `HTTP 409 Conflict error`;
The server hashes the password and does not store it in clear text in the database;
If the user is successfully registered, the server must return an `HTTP response status` of `201 Created` and the new user's data;
For all `POST` operations creating a new resource, the server returns a status of `201 Created`;
During the `POST` operation, user authentication, the server accepts a request with user data (email, password) in the body of the request;
If the user does not exist or the password does not match, an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized error` is returned;
The authorization mechanism using `JWT tokens` is implemented by a pair of tokens: an access token `access_token` and a refresh token `refresh_token`;

The API has the ability to perform the following actions:

1. Create a new contact;
2. Get a list of all contacts;
3. Get one contact by ID;
4. Update an existing contact;
5. Delete the contact;
6. Contacts are available for search by name, surname, email, phone or address;
7. The API can retrieve a list of contacts with birthdays for the next 7 days.
